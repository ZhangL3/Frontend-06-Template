          A web page can be displayed using a web browser. Web browsers often highlight and underline hypertext links and web pages can contain images.

        The <strong>Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.

      The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing.
      The <dfn>Internet</dfn> is a global system of interconnected computer networks.
      In contrast, the <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.[42]

      Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after channel surfing), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.[43]

    ET /home.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.org

followed by the content of the requested page. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) for a basic web page might look like this:

<code>
  <pre>
    &lt;html>
      &lt;head>
        &lt;title>Example.org – The World Wide Web&lt;/title>
      &lt;/head>
      &lt;body>
        &lt;p>&lt;/p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...&lt;/p>
      &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
  </pre>
</code>
